2. Change directory into the project folder: cd music-remover
3. Install the dependencies: npm install
4. Start the server: node index.js
5. Once the server is running, you can upload a song to the API at http://localhost:3000/api/upload and the server will return the vocals audio file in a .wav format.

### How It Works 🧠

This application uses the spleeter library to separate the vocals from the rest of the music. When a song is uploaded to the API, the application uses the spleeter library to split the song into its vocal and music components. The vocal component is then saved as a .wav file and returned as the response to the API request.
